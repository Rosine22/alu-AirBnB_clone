AirBnB clone - The console

The AirBnB clone project aims to deploy a simplified version of the AirBnB website on a server. Here is a summary of the project steps:

The Console:

Create the data model. Develop a command interpreter to manipulate data via a console. Implement storage and persistence of objects using a JSON file. Web Static:

Learn HTML/CSS. Create HTML templates for the application. Make the static HTML files dynamic by integrating data from files or databases. MySQL Storage:

Replace the file storage system with a database storage solution. Map models to database tables using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). Web Framework - Templating:

Build a web server in Python using a web framework. Render dynamic HTML templates by fetching data from files or databases. RESTful API:

Create a JSON web interface (API) to expose and manipulate stored objects. Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on objects via the API. Web Dynamic:

Learn JQuery. Load objects dynamically from the client-side using the RESTful API.

The command interpreter in the AirBnB clone project serves as a tool to manipulate data without a visual interface, similar to a Shell. It allows you to interact with the application's functionality and perform various actions. Here's an overview of how to start and use the command interpreter, along with some examples:

How to start the command interpreter

Open the terminal navigate to the directory where the project files are located run the "console.py" file to start the command interpreter.

How to use the command interpreter

Once the command interpreter is running, you can enter commands and interact with the application. The interpreter understands a set of predefined commands, and you can use them to manipulate data and perform actions within the application here are some examples :

1. creating a new User instance (command prompt) create User
2. display all instance of a specific class (command prompt) all User (user is replaced by the appropriate class name)
3. display all instances across all classes (command prompt) all
